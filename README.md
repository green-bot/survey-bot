## Annoated Bot Code - Full source in repo


  

```
require './lib/greenbot.rb' # ./lib/greenbot.rb contains helper libraries

def handle(prompt, fieldName= nil)

```







If there's nothing to tell or ask, get out of here.


  

```
  return unless prompt

  if fieldName.nil?

```







No field name, so just say it.


  

```
    tell prompt if prompt
  else

```







If there's a field name, then we are asking for something.
Ask and remember the answer


  

```
    answer = ask prompt
    answer.remember(fieldName)
  end
end


```







Ask the first two prompts.


  

```
handle ENV['PROMPT_1']
handle ENV['PROMPT_2']


```







Ask the guest for their name, if configured
Don't use handle because we want to confirm their name


  

```
if ENV['NAME_PROMPT']
  name = confirmed_gets(ENV['NAME_PROMPT'])
  name.remember('name')
end


```







For each of the ten possible questions, ask them if they are configured
and save the answer


  

```
%w( QUESTION_1 QUESTION_2 QUESTION_3
    QUESTION_4 QUESTION_5 QUESTION_6
    QUESTION_7 QUESTION_8 QUESTION_9
    QUESTION_10 ).each { |p| handle(ENV[p], p) }

handle ENV['SIGNATURE']


```
